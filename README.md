So this was a fun little project to build an RPS game in the console. 

The next Steps would be: 
  To create an interface for play in the browser outside of the console.
  Add functionality for choosing how many rounds.
  Maybe add a timer to force quick choices?
    Timed rounds sounds silly, but it would be a good exercise!
  Create some simple animations for the R,P, and S?

Luckily the core functions are there, so this will be achievable when 
I learn enough about the DOM and get some more HTML and CSS under my belt!

If I have more ideas, I will add them here!
